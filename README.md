👋 Hi, I’m @kalebakeits\
🏃 I run, bike and swim a lot\
💼 I have been working as a Sofware Engineer since 2022\
🤖 I’m interested in robotics and just tech in general\
🧑‍🎓 I have a Master's in Computer Science and a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering\

I primarily do C# (.NET backends) but I've also done a lot of hobby projects in Python, Javascript, PHP (I actually like it!) and to a lesser extent, MatLab.\
I like 2000s and early 2010s tech (back when it was usable and not just bloat). Outside of programming, I enjoy playing Minecraft or Call of Duty, and drawing.
I also swim, bike and run A LOT. I'm trainging for an IronMan 70.3 triathlon (will update on how it goes)
